## Data Set Information:
The data set used for this course projects is a subset of data collected from experiments that have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years performing six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

###For each record it is provided:
* Its activity label.
* An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
* A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 


## List of variables
It has been considered only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement provided in the original data set from the experiments.
